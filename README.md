# str.lower()
The str.lower() method in Python is used to convert all the uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. It does not modify any non-alphabetic characters, and the original string remains unchanged since strings are immutable in Python
# str.upper()
The str.upper() method converts all the lowercase characters in a string to uppercase. But, Non-alphabetic characters like numbers, symbols, and spaces remain unchanged.
# str.title()
The str.title() method is used to convert the first character of each word in a string to uppercase and the rest of the characters to lowercase. This method is particularly useful for formatting strings to resemble titles or headings.
# str.capitalize()
The str.capitalize() method is used to convert the first character of a string to uppercase and all other characters to lowercase. This method is useful when you want to ensure that a string starts with a capital letter while making all other letters lowercase.
# str.swapcase()
The str.swapcase() method is a string method that returns a new string with all the uppercase letters converted to lowercase and all the lowercase letters converted to uppercase. It does not modify the original string but instead creates and returns a new one.v
# str.find()
The str.find() method is used to search for a substring within a string and returns the lowest index where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
# str.index()
The str.index() method is similar to str.find() it searches for a substring within a string and returns the lowest index where the substring is found. The key difference is that str.index() raises a ValueError if the substring is not found, while str.find() returns -1.
