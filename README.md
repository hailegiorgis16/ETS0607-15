# str.lower()
The str.lower() method in Python is used to convert all the uppercase characters in a string to lowercase. It does not modify any non-alphabetic characters, and the original string remains unchanged since strings are immutable in Python
# str.upper()
The str.upper() method converts all the lowercase characters in a string to uppercase. But, Non-alphabetic characters like numbers, symbols, and spaces remain unchanged.
# str.title()
The str.title() method is used to convert the first character of each word in a string to uppercase and the rest of the characters to lowercase. This method is particularly useful for formatting strings to resemble titles or headings.
# str.capitalize()
The str.capitalize() method is used to convert the first character of a string to uppercase and all other characters to lowercase. This method is useful when you want to ensure that a string starts with a capital letter while making all other letters lowercase.
# str.swapcase()
The str.swapcase() method is a string method that returns a new string with all the uppercase letters converted to lowercase and all the lowercase letters converted to uppercase. It does not modify the original string but instead creates and returns a new one.v
# str.find()
The str.find() method is used to search for a substring within a string and returns the lowest index where the substring is found. If the substring is not found, it returns -1.
# str.index()
The str.index() method is similar to str.find() it searches for a substring within a string and returns the lowest index where the substring is found. The key difference is that str.index() raises a ValueError if the substring is not found, while str.find() returns -1.
# str.startswith()
The str.startswith() method checks if a string starts with a specified substring (or any of multiple possible prefixes) and returns True or False.
# str.endswith()
The str.endswith() method checks if a string ends with a specified suffix (or any of multiple possible suffixes) and returns True or False. It's the counterpart to str.startswith().
# str.count()
The str.count() method returns the number of times a specified substring appears in a given string. If the the substring in not found, it returns 0.
# str.replace()
The str.replace() method returns a new string where all occurrences of a specified substring are replaced with another substring.
# str.strip()
The strip() method is a built-in string function used to remove leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) or specified characters from a string.
# str.lstrip()
The lstrip() method is a string method that returns a copy of the string with leading characters removed from the left side. By default, it removes whitespace characters, but you can specify which characters to remove.
# str.rstrip()
The rstrip() method is a string method that returns a copy of the string with trailing characters removed from the right side. Like lstrip(), it defaults to removing whitespace but can remove specified characters.
# str.split()
The split() method breaks up a string at the specified separator and returns a list of substrings.
# str.join()
The str.join() method is a string method that concatenates (joins together) elements of an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) with the string acting as a separator between each element.
